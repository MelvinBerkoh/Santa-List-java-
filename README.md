# Santa-List-java-
Santa Claus allegedly keeps lists of those who are naughty and those who are nice.   On the naughty list are the names of those who will get coal in their stockings.  On the nice list are those who will receive gifts.  Each object in this list contains a name (an Instance of Name, as defined in Listing C-1 of Appendix C) and a list of that person’s presents (an instance of an ADT list).
Design an ADT for the objects NicePerson in Santa’s List.  Specify each ADT operation by stating its purpose, by describing its parameters, and by writing preconditions and post-conditions.
•    Write the interface for the ADT- NicePerson.
•    Write the class that implements the interface for the nice person, this class should create nice person items (which contain a name and a list of presents).
•    Write a client class that creates some instances of nice person class and place them in the list.
